"Motivation is overrated, says LinkedIn member Anshuman Sengar.

Instead one must focus on showing up every day.

""Consistency builds momentum, and momentum beats motivation every time,"" Sengar adds.

How do you stay motivated at work? Share your thoughts in the comments section. Let’s be honest, we cannot be motivated every single time we're working on our goal 💭


Let’s face it—when life feels like one big dead end, staying motivated isn’t just hard—it feels pointless.

We hear advice like “stay positive” ✨ or “trust the process” 📈, but sometimes, those words hit like empty clichés.

Here’s what I’ve learned from my own tough days:

💡 Motivation is overrated.
It’s fleeting, unreliable, and rarely there when you need it most. Instead, focus on Showing Up.

When results seem impossible, stop obsessing over them. Do the work for the sake of doing it.

✅ Do one thing every day toward your goal, no matter how small.
Some days, it was 10 minutes of effort; other days, it was hours.

Consistency builds momentum, and momentum beats motivation every time. 🚀",Unknown,160,2025-01-18 17:24:58

"Leadership isn’t about being the smartest person in the room, says LinkedIn member Rajiv Talreja.

Leadership isn’t about being the ""smartest person in the room"".
It’s about being the one who asks, Why?

""Why are we stuck here?""

"While years of experience is important for hiring, what's more important is the potential iof the candidate, says Ghazal Alagh, founder at Honasa Consumer Ltd.

It brings in fresh perspective and innovation within the team, she says.""Experience might open the door, but potential is what keeps it open and drives true growth,"" Alagh adds.

What other factors should recruiters keep in mind while hiring candidates? Share your thoughts in the comments section. “What do we look for in a candidate?” 

Since we are actively expanding and building our team at Honasa Consumer Ltd.I want to address a question Varun and I often get asked.

But first, let me share what we don’t prioritize: Years of experience.

While no one can deny the role experience plays but you know what matters far more? Potential.

Who you have the potential to become is way more importance than who you currently are.

This principle has been a game-changer for us as entrepreneurs. Hiring for potential brings the unique edge every team needs.

Here’s why:
● Passion can’t be taught: Experience is valuable, but a willingness to learn and grow is priceless.
● Fresh perspectives drive innovation: Potential brings curious, fearless minds ready to challenge norms and think differently.
● Building for the future: Those who see the big picture, beyond immediate tasks, are what set teams apart.

Experience might open the door, but potential is what keeps it open and drives true growth. This approach has shaped our teams and redefined how we build for the future.",Unknown,139,2025-01-18 17:25:06

"Which is better: A $500K bonus upfront, or $100K per year for 5 years?

Let’s break it down with a real-world example:

You’re married filing jointly with a $100K W-2 salary, live in a state with no income tax, and aren’t contributing to a 401(k) or HSA. This means all of your bonus is available to invest after covering taxes and normal living expenses.

To simplify, let’s first calculate your constant salary: Federal tax on $100K salary is $7,923, Social Security is $6,200, and Medicare is $1,450. This leaves $84,427 as your annual take-home pay, which we assume covers your living expenses. Anything from the bonus is entirely available to invest.

Here’s how the bonus options compare:

Scenario 1: A $500K bonus upfront

This puts your total income at $600K. Since higher incomes are taxed at higher rates, your taxes break down as follows: Social Security tax is $10,918 (maxed out), Medicare tax is $8,700, and federal tax (after the $30K standard deduction) is $138,595.

Your total tax bill is $158,213, leaving a net bonus of $441,787. After subtracting your $84,427 salary (already accounted for normal living expenses), you have $357,360 to invest at the end of year 1.

If invested at an 8% annual return (compounded monthly) for 4 years, it grows to $491,608.

Scenario 2: Five $100K bonuses over 5 years

Each $100K bonus puts your total income at $200K, which means lower taxes per year compared to Scenario 1. Taxes break down as follows: Social Security tax is $10,918, Medicare tax is $2,900, and federal tax (after the $30K standard deduction) is $27,228.

Your total taxes per year are $41,046, leaving a net bonus of $158,954 annually. After subtracting your $84,427 salary, you’re left with $74,527 to invest annually.

When invested annually at an 8% return (compounded monthly), these contributions grow to $439,843 by the end of year 5.

Although Scenario 2 results in more total principal to invest ($372,635 vs. $357,360 in Scenario 1), the time value of money makes a difference. Scenario 1’s upfront investment grows for a longer period, resulting in a higher future value.

Yes, paying more in taxes isn’t ideal, but as the saying goes, money now is better than money later.

"""I didn’t realize I had a 12-month non-compete"" 

The end result of a recent conversation with someone, late in the process with one of the world’s top hedge funds.

Despite asking them 2-3 times to review their contract, they were certain they only had a 3-month notice period with no NC.

Turns out, it was a 3-month notice followed by a 12-month non-compete.
They’ve been with their current fund for five years, having moved from their first job, on the sell-side, and hadn’t looked at their original contract since joining.

Unfortunately, assumptions like this can derail entire processes.

Not a fun call to make to the client. After all the time and energy invested, their ideal candidate isn’t available for 15 months…

Fortunately, in this case they are willing to wait, given the role and the scarcity of the individual’s skill set. Lucky.

But it doesn’t always work out like this.

While many clients are prepared to wait for exceptional talent, and lengthy NCs are now standard on the buy-side, not every role can accommodate such delays.

Save yourself and everyone else the trouble: always check your contract before starting the process.

Understand your notice period, non-compete clauses, and any restrictions upfront. Transparency saves time and spares a lot of frustration!",Unknown,112,2025-01-18 17:25:13
