"Founders must focus on doing things that do not scale, says Varun Limaye, founder at Mesa School of Business.

It helps founders understand the true nature of an underlying problem, get to interact very deeply with customers, and identify future scaling challenges, he says.

What should founders focus on at the initial stages? Share your thoughts in the comments section. The best piece of entrepreneurship advice I ever got: 

""Do things that do not scale."" 

So easily misunderstood, yet so simple and powerful.

When a founder does things that do not scale, they:
- understand the true nature of the underlying problem
- get to interact very deeply with customers and spend 1:1 time
- understand which part of solving the problem will introduce scaling challenges in the future

The worst thing that I hear folks say to me - when I sometimes just pick up the phone and start calling customers is - ""hey this is not scalable"".

Trust me when I say this - Scaling a potential solution to a problem is much much simpler than: finding a problem, understanding it, building a solution which is 5x better than alternative and creating customer love.

Do the latter first, scaling will follow!",Unknown,211,2025-01-19 11:43:27

"Litigation is hard.
Being a jerk makes it harder.

But since it takes two to tango in a courtroom, here are five things I teach our young lawyers about litigation soft skills:

1. In the beginning of a case, pick up the phone.

Introduce yourself if you‚Äôve never had a case together. Catch up if you have.

By the way, this helps immensely with number two‚Ä¶

2. Ask what the other side needs.

Let‚Äôs be honest, both sides would almost always rather a case settle vs. go to trial. What does the other side need to help you talk to your client and make that happen?

Is it an expert report? To depose your client? To have their client be deposed and get a taste of what cross-examination might be like? To rattle some sabres so an adjuster can save some face?

Good lawyers don‚Äôt hide the damn ball.

3. Send your discovery requests as a pdf and a word doc.

You know you‚Äôre going to get asked the word version, just send it. Even if the lawyer doesn‚Äôt care, their paralegal appreciates it. This goes further than you‚Äôd think.

4. When the case is over, send the check (defense) and return the release plaintiff (promptly).

If you can‚Äôt do this, let the other side know why.

5. Have coffee, lunch, or a beer after trials.

Talk about your families, hobbies, and your next vacation; do not post mortem the case. There is power in broken bread.


If you are both young, you might have cases for the next 40 years.

Lawyers have long memories.

Let‚Äôs break it down with a real-world example:

You‚Äôre married filing jointly with a $100K W-2 salary, live in a state with no income tax, and aren‚Äôt contributing to a 401(k) or HSA. This means all of your bonus is available to invest after covering taxes and normal living expenses.

To simplify, let‚Äôs first calculate your constant salary: Federal tax on $100K salary is $7,923, Social Security is $6,200, and Medicare is $1,450. This leaves $84,427 as your annual take-home pay, which we assume covers your living expenses. Anything from the bonus is entirely available to invest.

Here‚Äôs how the bonus options compare:

Scenario 1: A $500K bonus upfront

This puts your total income at $600K. Since higher incomes are taxed at higher rates, your taxes break down as follows: Social Security tax is $10,918 (maxed out), Medicare tax is $8,700, and federal tax (after the $30K standard deduction) is $138,595.

Your total tax bill is $158,213, leaving a net bonus of $441,787. After subtracting your $84,427 salary (already accounted for normal living expenses), you have $357,360 to invest at the end of year 1.

If invested at an 8% annual return (compounded monthly) for 4 years, it grows to $491,608.

Scenario 2: Five $100K bonuses over 5 years

Each $100K bonus puts your total income at $200K, which means lower taxes per year compared to Scenario 1. Taxes break down as follows: Social Security tax is $10,918, Medicare tax is $2,900, and federal tax (after the $30K standard deduction) is $27,228.

Your total taxes per year are $41,046, leaving a net bonus of $158,954 annually. After subtracting your $84,427 salary, you‚Äôre left with $74,527 to invest annually.

When invested annually at an 8% return (compounded monthly), these contributions grow to $439,843 by the end of year 5.

Although Scenario 2 results in more total principal to invest ($372,635 vs. $357,360 in Scenario 1), the time value of money makes a difference. Scenario 1‚Äôs upfront investment grows for a longer period, resulting in a higher future value.

Yes, paying more in taxes isn‚Äôt ideal, but as the saying goes, money now is better than money later.

"Software development was way easier 25 years ago. When is it going to get easier again?

My career started doing Visual Basic 6.

Simple drag and drop visual editor for UIs.

Today we have React, Angular, Vue, MAUI, Flutter, etc.

They are way more complicated than 25 years ago and not very visual.

It is mostly JS/HTML/CSS hell.

We need a better way to visually build things.

Figma helps with initial designs.

What about editing later?

Anyone have any suggestions?",Unknown,179,2025-01-19 11:44:12
